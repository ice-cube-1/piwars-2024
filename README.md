I'm keeping this public as it's linked in places and might be useful for GCSE marking but this repo is old / unused.
The actual repo with code that we're using is <a href="https://github.com/ice-cube-1/piwars-2024-2">piwars-2024-2</a> so I reccomend looking at that instead (it's also simpler and more understandable)
